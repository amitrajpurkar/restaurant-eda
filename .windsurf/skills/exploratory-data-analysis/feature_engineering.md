# SKILL: Feature Engineering

## Purpose
Create meaningful, model-ready features.

## Principles
- Prefer domain-driven features
- Keep feature logic simple and testable
- Avoid feature explosion

## Techniques
- Aggregations
- Ratios and deltas
- Time-based features
- Encodings with clear intent

## Output Expectations
- Feature list with explanations
- Feature importance hypotheses
- Risks (leakage, collinearity)

## Constraints
- Do not use future data
- Keep transformations deterministic
