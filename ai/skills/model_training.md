# SKILL: Model Training

## Purpose
Train baseline and candidate models responsibly.

## Principles
- Start simple
- Establish baselines
- Prefer explainable models first

## Steps
1. Select baseline model
2. Define training/validation split
3. Train candidate models
4. Track hyperparameters
5. Document assumptions

## Output Expectations
- Trained models
- Training metrics
- Comparison against baseline

## Constraints
- No overfitting
- No silent hyperparameter tuning
