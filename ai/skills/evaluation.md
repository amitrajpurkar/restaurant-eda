# SKILL: Model Evaluation

## Purpose
Evaluate model quality, robustness, and risk.

## Principles
- Metrics must match business objective
- One metric is never enough
- Explain failures, not just successes

## Techniques
- Cross-validation
- Confusion matrix / ROC / PR curves
- Error analysis
- Stability checks

## Output Expectations
- Evaluation report
- Strengths & weaknesses
- Go / no-go recommendation

## Constraints
- No cherry-picking metrics
- No test-set leakage
